\f0\fs36 \cf0 We are pleased to introduce our claim frequency model, which automatically derives features from minimally processed telematics data. Our model combines a classical parametric regression model with a neural network, providing the benefits of both. The simplicity and interpretability of parametric models complement the ability of neural networks to capture intricate relationships and interactions among predictors, including nonlinear patterns. We explore three distinct outcome specifications: Poisson (for cross-sectional data), negative binomial (for cross-sectional data), and negative multinomial (for longitudinal data). Its performance is compared against that of a benchmark model using handcrafted telematics features.\
